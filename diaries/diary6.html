    <h1>Diary 2050:</h1>
    <p>
    <br>It’s been thirty years since the last time I write this diary. Can’t believe I did a lot of things stupid.

<br>I miss the village before it is flooded. There is no way to get away from Indonesia now. It’s a hell, we cannot afford food but there is no way to leave. We are not rich.

<br>We are forced to move to the hill of the island Kalimantan. The government said to prevent the rise of the sea level hundred years later, we have to transfer the city and populations to higher land gradually.

<br>It is harder and harder to find foods from the ocean like before. I don’t know what these foods provided by the government are made of.

<br>It is unfair that the child of rich people can go to school, but my child can’t. They promise the resource transfer from rich to poor, they are lying.

<br>The air is not the air before, there is something in the air that makes it not fresh anymore. It now smells like coal. It’s cloudy again, but we have to wear masks to not let these small particles harm our lungs.

<br>It’s getting warmer and warmer. People were talking about climate change, but what can we do about it? We cannot even get the living condition we want, how can we rather spend some effort to deal with that issue much far away.

<br>There are too many people, and the water supply is not enough. The water supply is short gradually since the government says it's acidic.

<br>What if the sea level rises again, where can we go? There are still millions of people. We are the abandoned groups.

<br>I have lost too much. I can never realize one day that my life will be influenced this much by the climate. It’s been several years I havn’t been back to that cape. It’s not just about the climate. It’s about human rights, it’s about the corrupt officials. We are settled in the crowded spaces, they are not really consider us human. Before we have to sacrifice this much to keep living, they are responsible to find the solutions.
