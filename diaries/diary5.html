    <h1>Diary 2045:</h1>
    <p>
      &emsp; I remember the good ol’ days when I always looked forward to the next season. The year was a continuous cycle of growing, cultivating, and setting up. Just like the cycle of life, the world was tranquil and we were prospering. But now, every season is a nightmare. Every summer, we seem to have higher all time temperatures and droughts that kill many of our crops. When that brutality is over, the monsoon season begins. As we did not have enough water in the previous season, now we have too much. The constant rain floods the rivers and in turn they ruin our farms. <br>
      &emsp; My country of India has been hit really hard by climate change; many of us were already subsistence farmers making barely enough to survive and the rising natural disaster rates have been devastating to us. The rich have been able to escape this devastation unscathed by moving to the colder regions of the country while we perish. India has been growing tremendously over the last few decades, but climate change increased the wealth inequality even more.

    <h1>Memoir</h1>
    <p>
      &emsp; Nana always told me that “life is a cycle of suffering created from our personal desires”. Oh nana, how amazing it was to hear her bedtime stories of her childhood and the wisdom of Buddha. “Why should we endure all this suffering and rebirth?” I asked her once. “To follow the path of enlightenment, to reach nirvana,” she told me as she blew out the candle and lay down to sleep beside me. She most certainly reached nirvana and is now somewhere else in the world, perhaps a fish swimming in the sea or a grasshopper in a meadow. This was many years ago, and now I am the “nana” to my grandkids that tells these stories. But unlike her, my cycle of suffering keeps getting worse the longer I am on this earth. I grew up as the civil war of my homeland, Sri Lanka was ending, and the future was looking bright. Our house and chena farm was slowly rebuilt and we could finally live peacefully and securely. Life was looking up for our little country, almost as if it reached its own nirvana. <br>
      &emsp; A few decades passed and I was the mother of two amazing children who took over our family's farm. But that's when the storm hit. The gusts of wind killed most of our crops and our walls received numerous cracks. We were meager farmers and we did not have nearly enough savings to rebuild everything that the storm had ruined. But we followed Buddha's teachings and persevered. We salvaged enough of the farm to survive until the next growing season. However, life only grew worse from there: Storms grew more frequent, with a devastating one occurring every several years. Ironically, the temperature also noticeably increased and the dry season grew longer and more destructive. It became harder to find water and many of my countrymen living in Moneragal and Polonnaruwa could no longer farm due to the higher temperatures and droughts. Many of those who did not flee the area early enough starved, praying that the land would return to its previous fertility. For what they’ve lived through, I hope they found the path towards enlightenment. <br>
      &emsp; Our country had ample time to warn us and offer those who were most affected more suitable land. But our new government did no such thing; Instead, the businessmen and politicians moved inland and bought up all remaining fertile land for themselves. They blamed these disasters on something called “climate change” and the pollution of other countries while ignoring their people. They refused to create any support programs and the politicians simply moved away while those with fewer resources suffered. Just like my nana taught me, the law of karma rules every creature on this earth and through all this suffering we will eventually reach harmony and arrive at nirvana.
